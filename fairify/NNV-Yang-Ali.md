# Neural Network Verification

For instruction, please direct to this link first:

Github [link](https://github.com/Elio-yang/nn-verification).

Later links are optimized for GitHub structure, therefore, please first open the GitHub link and then use the links inside the ``README`` file.

## Using ``α,β-CROWN``

This part could be tested using online notebook, check the link [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Zn8KTXAbsBEpoAEsOXPAEqiaMmyO-vW0?usp=sharing). Motivation and summary are presented. 

You could also check the local file [here](AB-CROWN-Report.ipynb). It's better to run this online.
